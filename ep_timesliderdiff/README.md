NOTE: This is a prototype to show a way to implement this functionality.  This plugin needs rewriting if you want to use it in production.

# TODO

* Styling
* Update diff on slide
* Remember position user last was on pad and compare then to now
* Lots...
* Use SocketIO instead of AJAX (for streaming when searching through large pads)
* UI polishing
* Progress indicator
* Test coverage
