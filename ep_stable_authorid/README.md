# ep\_stable\_authorid

Etherpad plugin to give authenticated users the same author ID every time they
log in. Different authenticated users get different author IDs.

Note: Etherpad limits the number of concurrent connections to one per pad per
author ID, so a single authenticated user will not be able to view the same pad
from two different browsers/tabs/devices at the same time (the older connection
will be automatically disconnected).

This plugin requires Etherpad v1.9.0 or later.

## Configuration

#### Example

The following shows the default settings:

```json
  "ep_stable_authorid": {
    "exclude": ["admin", "guest"]
  },
```

#### Details

  * `exclude` (optional, defaults to `["admin", "guest"]`): Users this plugin
    should ignore.

## Interaction with the ep\_guest Plugin

The [ep\_guest](https://github.com/ether/ep_guest#readme) plugin "authenticates"
anonymous users as a special guest user. Etherpad core does not treat this
special guest account specially when compared to any other user account. To make
it possible for multiple guest users to access a pad at the same time, add the
guest username to the `exclude` list.

When a user logs in or out their author ID will change, which avoids awkward
effects such as edits credited to someone named "Read-Only Guest".
