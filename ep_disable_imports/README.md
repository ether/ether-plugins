# ep_disable_imports

[Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) plugin to selectively or completely disable
imports.

## Installation

From the Etherpad working directory, run:

```shell
npm install --no-save --legacy-peer-deps ep_disable_imports
```

Or, install from Etherpad's `/admin/plugins` page.

## Configuration

All imports are disabled by default. To selectively disable certain file types,
edit your `settings.json`:

```json
  "ep_disable_imports": {
    // You can either deny specific filename extensions:
    "deny": ["etherpad", "docx"],
    // Or only permit select filename extensions:
    "allow": ["html"]
  },
```

Details:

  * `deny`: A list of case-insensitive filename extensions to prohibit. Any file
    with an extension in this list is rejected. A leading period is
    automatically added to each extension if missing.
  * `allow`: A list of case-insensitive filename extensions to allow. Any file
    with an extension not in this list is rejected. A leading period is
    automatically added to each extension if missing.

If neither `deny` nor `allow` are specified, all imports are prohibited. If both
`deny` and `allow` are specified, the file's extension must be in `allow` and
must not be in `deny` (`deny` takes precedence over `allow`).

## Testing

To run the backend tests, run the following from the Etherpad working directory:

```shell
(cd src && npm test)
```

To run the frontend tests, visit: http://localhost:9001/tests/frontend/
